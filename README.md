# CV
My personal CV; get the latest version [here](https://github.com/nnadeau/cv/releases/latest)

## Motivation
- I like systematic designs.
- [JSON Resume](https://github.com/jsonresume/) is awesome.
    - But its development has slowed down.
- [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) learning experience.
- Using [Python](https://www.python.org/) makes me happy.
